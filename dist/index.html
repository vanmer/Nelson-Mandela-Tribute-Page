            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa
            mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
            anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist
            who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was
            the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a
            fully representative democratic election. His government focused on
            dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised
            racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
            nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African
            National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <h3>Childhood: 1918–1934</h3>
            <p>
              Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in
              Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the
              forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning
              "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name,
              Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king
              of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South
              Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons,
              named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his
              surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the
              Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his
              cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to
              inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.

              Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela
              (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he
              was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was
              accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926,
              Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his
              father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's
              unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a
              polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who
              lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third
              wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House
              and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.

              Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by
              traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters
              in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended
              herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys.
              Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian,
              his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about
              seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English
              forename of "Nelson" by his teacher. When Mandela was about nine,
              his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed
              ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease. Feeling "cut
              adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud
              rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of fairness".

              "No one in my family had ever attended school ... On the first day
              of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English
              name. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was
              undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education. That day,
              Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why this
              particular name I have no idea." <br> – Nelson Mandela, 1994</br>
            </aside>
            <p>
              Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, 
              where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, 
              Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not see his mother again 
              for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland 
              treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, 
              Justice, and daughter, Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services 
              every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant 
              part of his life. He attended a Methodist mission school located 
              next to the palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and 
              geography. He developed a love of African history, listening to the 
              tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by 
              the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. At the time 
              he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors 
              but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to 
              southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled 
              to Tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically 
              marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the 
              name Dalibunga.
