            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa
            mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
            anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist
            who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was
            the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a
            fully representative democratic election. His government focused on
            dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised
            racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
            nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African
            National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <h3>Childhood: 1918–1934</h3>
          <p>
            Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata,
            then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename
            Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in
            later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba. His
            patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu
            people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern
            Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was
            Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. Because Mandela
            was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called
            "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal
            family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but
            recognised as hereditary royal councillors.

            Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela
            (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was
            appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused
            of corruption by a governing white magistrate.[9] In 1926, Gadla was
            also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had
            lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable
            demands.[10] A devotee of the god Qamata,[11] Gadla was a polygamist
            with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in
            different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni
            Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of
            the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.[12]
