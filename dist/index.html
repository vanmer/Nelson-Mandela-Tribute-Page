            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/; Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla];
            18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid
            revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist who served as
            President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
            first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
            representative democratic election. His government focused on
            dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised
            racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
            nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African
            National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in
            Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of
            Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a
            lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial
            and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and
            co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's
            white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial
            segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed
            themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed president of the
            ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in
            the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He
            was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was
            unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by
            Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party
            (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
            association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we
            Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He
            was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to
            life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following
            the Rivonia Trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island,
            Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic
            and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war,
            President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk
            led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the
            1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to
            victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government
            which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised
            reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the
            Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights
            abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its
            predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs,
            also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty
            and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as
            mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as
            secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He
            declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy,
            Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on
            combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela
            Foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although
            critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and
            those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and
            reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international
            acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy
            and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the
            Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa,
            where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and
            described as the "Father of the Nation".

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <section>
              <h3>Childhood: 1918–1934</h3>
              <p>
                Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in
                Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the
                forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning
                "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name,
                Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king
                of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South
                Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's
                sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of
                his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of
                the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants
                of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic,
                ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary
                royal councillors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela
                (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he
                was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was
                accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926,
                Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that
                his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's
                unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a
                polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who
                lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third
                wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand
                House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by
                traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters
                in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended
                herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other
                boys. Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout
                Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when
                he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the
                English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher. When Mandela was
                about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an
                undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.
                Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his
                father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of
                fairness".
              </p>
              <aside>
                "No one in my family had ever attended school ... On the first
                day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an
                English name. This was the custom among Africans in those days
                and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.
                That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why
                this particular name I have no idea." – Nelson Mandela, 1994
              </aside>
              <p>
                Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at
                Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the
                Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not
                see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that
                Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own
                child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter,
                Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with
                his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his
                life. He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the
                palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography.
                He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales
                told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by
                the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. At the
                time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as
                oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and
                other benefits to southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and
                several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the
                ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their
                transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name
                Dalibunga.

              <h3>Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940</h3>
              <p>
                Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for
                the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary
                education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a
                Western-style institution that was the largest school for black
                Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on
                an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude,
                becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began
                playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He
                completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved
                to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by
                most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster
                emphasised the superiority of English culture and government,
                but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African
                culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho,
                and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers,
                a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. Mandela spent much
                of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and
                boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a BA
                degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black
                institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students.
                There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native
                administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring
                to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs
                Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory,
                befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver
                Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to
                come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society
                play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local
                community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although
                he had friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC)
                who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire,
                Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist
                movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort
                when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a
                first-year students' house committee which challenged the
                dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year
                became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC)
                boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended
                from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.

              <h3>Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943</h3>
              <p>
                Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that
                Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed,
                they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April
                1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his
                "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was
                fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a
                runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who
                introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu.
                The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law
                firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar
                Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the
                firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Xhosa member of the ANC
                and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who
                became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party
                gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans,
                Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he
                did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his
                Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle
                as being racially based rather than as class warfare. To
                continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University
                of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's
                degree at night.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the
                Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with
                poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always remained a
                special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he
                briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his
                landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown
                Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the
                Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of
                various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs,
                he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941,
                Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for
                running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in
                the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for
                the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela
                returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer
                rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later
                stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply
                found [himself] doing so, and could not do otherwise."

              <h3>Law studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943–1949</h3>
              <p>
                Mandela began studying law at the University of the
                Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and
                faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist
                European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and
                Ruth First. Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943
                Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to
                reverse fare rises. Joining the ANC, he was increasingly
                influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at
                Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo.
                In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated
                with the "Africanist" branch of African nationalism, which was
                virulently opposed to a racially united front against
                colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the
                communists. Despite his friendships with non-blacks and
                communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that
                black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle
                for political self-determination. Deciding on the need for a
                youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their
                subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC
                President Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in
                Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL)
                was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social
                Centre, with Lembede as president and Mandela as a member of its
                executive committee.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Sisulu's house, Mandela met Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and
                ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei. Entering a relationship and
                marrying in October 1944, they initially lived with her
                relatives until moving into a rented house in the township of
                Orlando in early 1946. Their first child, Madiba "Thembi"
                Thembekile, was born in February 1945; a daughter, Makaziwe, was
                born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later. Mandela
                enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and his sister, Leabie,
                to stay with him. In early 1947, his three years of articles
                ended at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, and he decided to become
                a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare
                Trust.

                In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital,
                where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more
                moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and
                non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela
                disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an
                unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL,
                considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela was
                elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal
                Province branch, serving under regional president C. S.
                Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the
                committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela
                was one of those who forced his resignation.

                In the South African general election in 1948, in which only
                whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde
                Nasionale Party under Daniel François Malan took power, soon
                uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party.
                Openly racialist, the party codified and expanded racial
                segregation with new apartheid legislation. Gaining increasing
                influence in the ANC, Mandela and his party cadre allies began
                advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and
                strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South
                Africa's Indian community. Xuma did not support these measures
                and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence,
                replaced by James Moroka and a more militant executive committee
                containing Sisulu, Mda, Tambo, and Godfrey Pitje. Mandela later
                related that he and his colleagues had "guided the ANC to a more
                radical and revolutionary path." Having devoted his time to
                politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three
                times; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949.

              <h3>Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950–1954</h3>
              <p>
                Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March
                1950, and that same year was elected national president of the
                ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in
                Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist
                activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against
                apartheid and white minority rule. Mandela opposed the strike
                because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of
                black workers took part, resulting in increased police
                repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism
                Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the
                ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing
                against a racially united front, but was outvoted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thereafter, Mandela rejected Lembede's Africanism and embraced
                the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid. Influenced
                by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support
                for wars of national liberation, his mistrust of communism broke
                down and he began reading literature by Karl Marx, Vladimir
                Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist
                philosophy of dialectical materialism. Commenting on communism,
                he later stated that he "found [himself] strongly drawn to the
                idea of a classless society which, to [his] mind, was similar to
                traditional African culture where life was shared and communal."
                In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm,
                which was owned by a communist, although his increasing
                commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with
                his family.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign
                against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a
                National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers. The campaign was
                designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced
                by Mahatma Gandhi; some supported this for ethical reasons, but
                Mandela instead considered it pragmatic. At a Durban rally on 22
                June, Mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000 people,
                initiating the campaign protests for which he was arrested and
                briefly interned in Marshall Square prison. These events
                established Mandela as one of the best-known black political
                figures in South Africa. With further protests, the ANC's
                membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000 members; the government
                responded with mass arrests and introduced the Public Safety
                Act, 1953 to permit martial law. In May, authorities banned
                Transvaal ANC President J. B. Marks from making public
                appearances; unable to maintain his position, he recommended
                Mandela as his successor. Although Africanists opposed his
                candidacy, Mandela was elected to be regional president in
                October.
              </p>
              <p>
                In July 1952, Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of
                Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused—among
                them Moroka, Sisulu, and Yusuf Dadoo—in Johannesburg. Found
                guilty of "statutory communism", a term that the government used
                to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine
                months' hard labour was suspended for two years. In December,
                Mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or
                talking to more than one individual at a time, making his
                Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period the
                Defiance Campaign petered out. In September 1953, Andrew Kunene
                read out Mandela's "No Easy Walk to Freedom" speech at a
                Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by
                Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, a seminal influence
                on Mandela's thought. The speech laid out a contingency plan for
                a scenario in which the ANC was banned. This Mandela Plan, or
                M-Plan, involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure
                with a more centralised leadership.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and
                Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel,
                passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney.
                In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm,
                Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only
                African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with
                aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality.
                Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to
                a remote location after their office permit was removed under
                the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a
                lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of
                Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much
                respect from the black community. Although a second daughter,
                Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship
                with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He
                may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary
                Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this
                period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted
                by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while
                Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's
                preoccupation with politics.

              <h3>Congress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955–1961</h3>
              <p>
                After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the
                forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb
                of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent
                action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority
                rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's
                Republic of China, which was denied. Although the Chinese
                government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed
                the movement insufficiently prepared for guerrilla warfare. With
                the involvement of the South African Indian Congress, the
                Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade
                Unions and the Congress of Democrats, the ANC planned a Congress
                of the People, calling on all South Africans to send in
                proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a
                Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling for the
                creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the
                nationalisation of major industry. The charter was adopted at a
                June 1955 conference in Kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended the
                event, which was forcibly closed down by police. The tenets of
                the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956
                he described it as "an inspiration to the people of South
                Africa".

                We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and

                authority unless it is based on the will of the people. –
                Opening words of the Freedom Charter
              </aside>
              <p>
                Following the end of a second ban in September 1955, Mandela
                went on a working holiday to Transkei to discuss the
                implications of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 with local
                tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and Noengland before
                proceeding to Cape Town. In March 1956 he received his third ban
                on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five
                years, but he often defied it. Mandela's marriage broke down and
                Evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother.
                Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956, she claimed that
                Mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations,
                and fought for custody of their children. She withdrew her
                petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for
                divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March,
                with the children placed in Evelyn's care. During the divorce
                proceedings, he began courting a social worker, Winnie
                Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. She later
                became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in
                prison. Together they had two children: Zenani, born in February
                1959, and Zindziswa (1960–2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC
                national executive, and accused of "high treason" against the
                state. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they
                underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail.
                The defence's refutation began in January 1957, overseen by
                defence lawyer Vernon Berrangé, and continued until the case was
                adjourned in September. In January 1958, Oswald Pirow was
                appointed to prosecute the case, and in February the judge ruled
                that there was "sufficient reason" for the defendants to go on
                trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court. The formal Treason Trial
                began in Pretoria in August 1958, with the defendants
                successfully applying to have the three judges—all linked to the
                governing National Party—replaced. In August, one charge was
                dropped, and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment,
                submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that
                the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent
                revolution, a charge the defendants denied.
              </p>
              <p>
                In April 1959, Africanists dissatisfied with the ANC's united
                front approach founded the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC);
                Mandela disagreed with the PAC's racially exclusionary views,
                describing them as "immature" and "naïve". Both parties took
                part in an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which Africans
                burned the passes that they were legally obliged to carry. One
                of the PAC-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police,
                resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the Sharpeville
                massacre. The incident brought international condemnation of the
                government and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa, with
                Mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of
                emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC
                and PAC; in March, they arrested Mandela and other activists,
                imprisoning them for five months without charge in the
                unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison. Imprisonment
                caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason
                Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided
                that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused
                were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in
                late August 1960. Over the following months, Mandela used his
                free time to organise an All-In African Conference near
                Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400
                anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike
                to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic. On 29
                March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges
                produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was
                insufficient evidence to convict the accused of "high treason",
                since they had advocated neither communism nor violent
                revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.

              <h3>MK, the SACP, and African tour: 1961–62</h3>
              <p>
                Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country
                incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the
                planned mass stay-at-home strike. Referred to as the "Black
                Pimpernel" in the press—a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel
                The Scarlet Pimpernel—a warrant for his arrest was put out by
                the police. Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and
                after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned
                them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to
                violence through groups like the PAC's Poqo. He believed that
                the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this
                violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader
                Albert Luthuli—who was morally opposed to violence—and allied
                activist groups of its necessity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by the actions of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement
                in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo
                co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", abbreviated
                MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained
                ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by Marxist militants
                Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl
                von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate
                from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was
                later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK
                members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela
                in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat
                in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm
                in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and
                Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in
                later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a
                member of the Communist Party, historical research published in
                2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or
                early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC
                after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a
                member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.
              </p>
              <aside>
                We of Umkhonto have always sought to achieve liberation without
                bloodshed and civil clash. We hope, even at this late hour, that
                our first actions will awaken everyone to a realization of the
                dangerous situation to which Nationalist policy is leading. We
                hope that we will bring the Government and its supporters to
                their senses before it is too late, so that both government and
                its policies can be changed before matters reach the desperate
                stage of civil war. — Statement released by MK to announce the

                with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military
                installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport
                links at night, when civilians were not present. Mandela stated
                that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful
                action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for
                racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged
                that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have
                been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the
                Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57
                bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by
                further attacks on New Year's Eve.

                The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February
                1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East,
                Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
                Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on his way
                Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius
                Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile
                Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the
                conference. After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt,
                admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser,
                and then went to Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba
                gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali,
                Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from
                Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed
                Sékou Touré. He left Africa for London, England, where he met
                anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians.
                Upon returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in
                guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being
                recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.

              <h3>Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–1964</h3>
              <p>
                On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow
                activist Cecil Williams near Howick. Many MK members suspected
                that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to
                Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas
                little credence. In later years, Donald Rickard, a former
                American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency,
                who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed
                the South African police of his location. Jailed in
                Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with
                inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without
                permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor,
                Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase "the ANC's moral
                opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the
                court. Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began
                correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from
                the University of London International Programmes. His hearing
                began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a
                traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning
                his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he
                was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the
                courtroom, supporters sang "Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika".
              </p>
              <p>
                On 11 July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting those
                they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's
                activities, some of which mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial
                began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his
                comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to
                violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was
                Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the
                prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar
                reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December
                1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing
                thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.

                I have fought against white domination, and I have fought
                against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a
                democratic and free society in which all persons will live
                together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal
                which I hope to live for and to see realised. But if it needs
                be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. —Mandela's

              <p>
                Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK, Mandela
                and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that
                they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the
                government. They used the trial to highlight their political
                cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave
                his three-hour "I Am Prepared to Die" speech. That speech—which
                was inspired by Castro's "History Will Absolve Me"—was widely
                reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial
                gained international attention; there were global calls for the
                release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace
                Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to
                its presidency. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela
                and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although
                the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied,
                the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.

              <h3>Robben Island: 1964–1982</h3>
              <p>
                In 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from
                Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the
                next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section
                B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8
                feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to
                sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison
                wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking
                rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to
                work in a lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden to wear
                sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his
                eyesight. At night, he worked on his LLB degree which he was
                obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence
                course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden,
                and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions
                for the possession of smuggled news clippings. He was initially
                classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning
                that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months,
                although all mail was heavily censored.
              </p>
              <p>
                The political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikes—the
                latter considered largely ineffective by Mandela—to improve
                prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the
                anti-apartheid struggle. ANC prisoners elected him to their
                four-man "High Organ" along with Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, and
                Raymond Mhlaba, and he involved himself in a group representing
                all political prisoners (including Eddie Daniels) on the island,
                Ulundi, through which he forged links with PAC and Yu Chi Chan
                Club members. Initiating the "University of Robben Island",
                whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise, he
                debated socio-political topics with his comrades
              </p>
              <p>
                Though attending Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied
                Islam. He also studied Afrikaans, hoping to build a mutual
                respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various
                official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the
                liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the
                Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of
                prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party
                politician Denis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy
                Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get
                along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly
                after, and his firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the
                following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either
                funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly
                imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first
                visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in
                1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable
                to see him.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 1967 onwards, prison conditions improved; black prisoners
                were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted,
                and the standard of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape
                plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was
                abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by an agent of
                the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to
                see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet
                Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an
                increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners,
                complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He
                was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a
                co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve
                prison standards
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1975, Mandela had become a Class A prisoner, which allowed
                him greater numbers of visits and letters. He corresponded with
                anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond
                Tutu. That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled
                to London, but remained unpublished at the time; prison
                authorities discovered several pages, and his LLB study
                privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, he devoted his
                spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities
                permitted him to resume his LLB degree studies in 1980.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve
                Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). Seeing the ANC
                as ineffectual, the BCM called for militant action, but
                following the Soweto uprising of 1976, many BCM activists were
                imprisoned on Robben Island. Mandela tried to build a
                relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical
                of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid
                activists. Renewed international interest in his plight came in
                July 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday. He was awarded
                an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for
                International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of
                the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. In March 1980, the slogan
                "Free Mandela!" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza,
                sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security
                Council to call for his release. Despite increasing foreign
                pressure, the government refused, relying on its Cold War allies
                US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret
                Thatcher; both considered Mandela's ANC a terrorist organisation
                sympathetic to communism, and supported its suppression.

              <h3>Pollsmoor Prison: 1982–1988</h3>
              <p>
                In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in
                Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu,
                Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they
                believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence
                on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor
                were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the
                camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with
                Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was
                permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and
                corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was
                appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front
                (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African
                President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had
                permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own
                parliaments, which had control over education, health, and
                housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like
                Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the
                anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.
              </p>
              <p>
                The early 1980s witnessed an escalation of violence across the
                country, and many predicted civil war. This was accompanied by
                economic stagnation as various multinational banks—under
                pressure from an international lobby—had stopped investing in
                South Africa. Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release
                Mandela—then at the height of his international fame—to defuse
                the volatile situation. Although considering Mandela a dangerous
                "arch-Marxist", in February 1985 Botha offered him a release
                from prison if he "unconditionally rejected violence as a
                political weapon". Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a
                statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, "What freedom am
                I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC]
                remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot
                enter into contracts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1985, Mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate
                gland, before being given new solitary quarters on the ground
                floor. He was met by "seven eminent persons", an international
                delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but Botha's
                government refused to co-operate, calling a state of emergency
                in June and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. The
                anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the ANC committing
                231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. The violence escalated as
                the government used the army and police to combat the
                resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and
                the Zulu nationalist movement Inkatha, which was involved in an
                increasingly violent struggle with the ANC. Mandela requested
                talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with
                Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, and having a further
                11 meetings over the next three years. Coetsee organised
                negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government
                figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of
                political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the
                condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links
                with the Communist Party, and not insist on majority rule.
                Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would
                end its armed activities only when the government renounced
                violence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandela's 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international
                attention, including a tribute concert at London's Wembley
                Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200
                million viewers. Although presented globally as a heroic figure,
                he faced personal problems when ANC leaders informed him that
                Winnie had set herself up as head of a gang, the "Mandela United
                Football Club", which had been responsible for torturing and
                killing opponents—including children—in Soweto. Though some
                encouraged him to divorce her, he decided to remain loyal until
                she was found guilty by trial.

              <p>
                Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions
                in his cell, in December 1988, Mandela was moved to Victor
                Verster Prison near Paarl. He was housed in the relative comfort
                of a warder's house with a personal cook, and he used the time
                to complete his LLB degree. While there, he was permitted many
                visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC
                leader Oliver Tambo.

                In 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; although he would retain the
                state presidency, he stepped down as leader of the National
                Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move,
                Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an
                invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as
                state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president
                believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number
                of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in
                November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate
                legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were
                deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in
                December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered
                friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political
                parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional
                release. Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years,
                photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South
                Africa.

                Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held
                Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the
                event was broadcast live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's
                City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his
                commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority,
                but he made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not over
                and would continue as "a purely defensive action against the
                violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government
                would agree to negotiations, so that "there may no longer be the
                need for the armed struggle", and insisted that his main focus
                was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right
                to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home,
                in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and
                press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at
                Johannesburg's FNB Stadium.

            <section>
              <h3>Early negotiations: 1990–91</h3>
              <p>
                Mandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and
                politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and
                continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and
                London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An
                International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley
                Stadium. Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions
                against the apartheid government, he met President François
                Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and
                Thatcher in the United Kingdom. In the United States, he met
                President George H.W. Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress
                and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the
                African-American community. In Cuba, he became friends with
                President Castro, whom he had long admired. He met President R.
                Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime
                Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob
                Hawke in Australia. He visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union,
                a longtime ANC supporter.
              </p>
              <p>
                In May 1990, Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into
                preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11
                Afrikaner men. Mandela impressed them with his discussions of
                Afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the Groot Schuur
                Minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency.
                In August, Mandela—recognising the ANC's severe military
                disadvantage—offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which
                he was widely criticised by MK activists. He spent much time
                trying to unify and build the ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg
                conference in December attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom
                found him more moderate than expected. At the ANC's July 1991
                national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted that the party
                had faults and announced his aim to build a "strong and
                well-oiled task force" for securing majority rule. At the
                conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing
                Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national
                executive was elected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC
                headquarters at Shell House, Johannesburg, and moved into
                Winnie's large Soweto home. Their marriage was increasingly
                strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he
                supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He
                gained funding for her defence from the International Defence
                and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar
                Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to
                six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992,
                Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC
                forced her to step down from the national executive for
                misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white
                Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. Mandela's prospects for a
                peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in
                "black-on-black" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha
                supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of
                deaths. Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC
                prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela argued that
                there was a "third force" within the state intelligence services
                fuelling the "slaughter of the people" and openly blamed de
                Klerk—whom he increasingly distrusted—for the Sebokeng massacre.
                In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in
                Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a
                peace accord, though the violence continued.

              <h3>CODESA talks: 1991–92</h3>
              <p>
                The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in
                December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended
                by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although Cyril
                Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key
                figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn
                the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as
                the "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime".
                Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was
                achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk
                insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal
                system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of
                ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary
                system governed by majority rule. Following the Boipatong
                massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants,
                Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting
                of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he
                called for a special session of the UN Security Council and
                proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South
                Africa to prevent "state terrorism". Calling for domestic mass
                action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in
                South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the Bisho massacre, in which 28 ANC supporters and one
                soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a
                protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to
                further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He
                agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners
                be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that
                Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures
                intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk
                reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial
                general election would be held, resulting in a five-year
                coalition government of national unity and a constitutional
                assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The
                ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil
                servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism.
                The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal
                democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a
                constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights;
                it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its
                own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's
                desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.
              </p>
              <p>
                The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South
                Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist
                groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June
                1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging
                (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following
                the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised
                speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral
                in Soweto for Tambo, who had died of a stroke. In July 1993,
                both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting
                President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal.
                Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel
                Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began
                meeting with big business figures, and played down his support
                for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away
                much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist
                ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private
                enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist
                parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.

              <h3>General election: 1994</h3>
              <p>
                With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began
                campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating
                People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could
                appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South
                Africans. The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development
                Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years,
                introduce universal free education and extend access to water
                and electricity. The party's slogan was "a better life for all",
                although it was not explained how this development would be
                funded. With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New
                Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing
                continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or
                Democratic Party. Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for
                the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy
                donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime. He
                also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected
                by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly
                in the wake of the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell
                House massacre—incidents of violence involving the AWB and
                Inkatha, respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and
                generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen,
                persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de
                Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the
                elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders
                of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a
                televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the
                better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand
                surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory
                for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence,
                although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely
                expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the
                vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to
                unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also
                victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National
                Party each taking one. Mandela voted at the Ohlange
                High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his
                election as president, he publicly accepted that the election
                had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.
