            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa
            mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
            anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist
            who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was
            the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a
            fully representative democratic election. His government focused on
            dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised
            racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
            nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African
            National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in
            Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of
            Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a
            lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial
            and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and
            co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's
            white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial
            segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed
            themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed president of the
            ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in
            the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He
            was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was
            unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by
            Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party
            (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
            association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we
            Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He
            was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to
            life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following
            the Rivonia Trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island,
            Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic
            and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war,
            President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk
            led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the
            1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to
            victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government
            which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised
            reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the
            Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights
            abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its
            predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs,
            also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty
            and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as
            mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as
            secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He
            declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy,
            Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on
            combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela
            Foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although
            critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and
            those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and
            reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international
            acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy
            and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the
            Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa,
            where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and
            described as the "Father of the Nation".

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <section>
              <h3>Childhood: 1918–1934</h3>
              <p>
                Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in
                Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the
                forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning
                "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name,
                Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king
                of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South
                Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's
                sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of
                his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of
                the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants
                of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic,
                ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary
                royal councillors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela
                (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he
                was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was
                accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926,
                Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that
                his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's
                unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a
                polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who
                lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third
                wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand
                House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by
                traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters
                in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended
                herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other
                boys. Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout
                Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when
                he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the
                English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher. When Mandela was
                about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an
                undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.
                Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his
                father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of
                fairness".
              </p>
              <aside>
                "No one in my family had ever attended school ... On the first
                day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an
                English name. This was the custom among Africans in those days
                and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.
                That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why
                this particular name I have no idea." – Nelson Mandela, 1994
              </aside>
              <p>
                Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at
                Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the
                Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not
                see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that
                Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own
                child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter,
                Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with
                his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his
                life. He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the
                palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography.
                He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales
                told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by
                the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. At the
                time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as
                oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and
                other benefits to southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and
                several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the
                ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their
                transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name
                Dalibunga.

              <h3>Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940</h3>
              <p>
                Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for
                the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary
                education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a
                Western-style institution that was the largest school for black
                Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on
                an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude,
                becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began
                playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He
                completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved
                to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by
                most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster
                emphasised the superiority of English culture and government,
                but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African
                culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho,
                and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers,
                a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. Mandela spent much
                of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and
                boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a BA
                degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black
                institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students.
                There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native
                administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring
                to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs
                Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory,
                befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver
                Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to
                come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society
                play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local
                community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although
                he had friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC)
                who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire,
                Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist
                movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort
                when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a
                first-year students' house committee which challenged the
                dominance of the second-years,[38] and at the end of his first
                year became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC)
                boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended
                from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.

              <h3>Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943</h3>
              <p>
                Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that
                Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed,
                they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April
                1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his
                "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was
                fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a
                runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who
                introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu.
                The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law
                firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar
                Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the
                firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Xhosa member of the ANC
                and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who
                became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party
                gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans,
                Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he
                did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his
                Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle
                as being racially based rather than as class warfare. To
                continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University
                of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's
                degree at night.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the
                Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with
                poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always remained a
                special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty,
                he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting
                his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to
                downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the
                Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of
                various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs,
                he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941,
                Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for
                running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in
                the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for
                the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943,
                Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a
                lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland.
                He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he
                "simply found [himself] doing so, and could not do
                otherwise."
